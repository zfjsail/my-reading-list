* [Multimodal Generative Models for Scalable Weakly-Supervised Learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7801-multimodal-generative-models-for-scalable-weakly-supervised-learning.pdf), *Mike Wu, Noah Goodman.* NeurIPS 2018.
  - *multimodel, variational inference*
  - introduce a multimodal variational autoencoder to learn a joint representation of these modalities with a product-of-experts inference network and a sub-sampled training paradigm.
